onscreenresize is a tiny C program that listens for xrandr events and
executes a command of your choice when they occur. I use it to redraw my
desktop wallpaper whenever I resize a VirtualBox window.

To install, run make, then copy the onscreenresize executable somewhere
on your PATH. If make complains about missing headers, make sure you
have libx11-dev and libxrandr-dev installed (on Debian/Ubuntu).

EXAMPLES

  # Run ~/.fehbg every time the screen resizes, but not more than once
  # every 500ms
  onscreenresize 500 ~/.fehbg

  # Echo 'resized' every time the screen resizes
  onscreenresize 0 'echo resized'
